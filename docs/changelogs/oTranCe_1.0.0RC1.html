    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-37'>OTC-37</a>] -         Refactoring Msd_Configuration
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-47'>OTC-47</a>] -         An admin should be able to generally activate/deactivate the use of a vcs.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-48'>OTC-48</a>] -         A user should only see the vcs options if the admin generally activated vcs.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-49'>OTC-49</a>] -         Export to VCS should only be shown if the project uses vcs.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-52'>OTC-52</a>] -         Move fallback language setting to project tab because this is a general setting. Afterwadrs rename tab export to vcs.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-55'>OTC-55</a>] -         Fine tune settings of rights for user.
        An admin should be able to configure the rights for a user more fine grained.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-56'>OTC-56</a>] -         DB design problem: it is only possible to save positive user rights into table userrights. Because the language edit rights are also stored in this table, but they buld a valid value of all three combinations of fields, we are stuck here.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-60'>OTC-60</a>] -         When importing the same validation rules for a language key should be applied like when creating a new key manually.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-63'>OTC-63</a>] -         If an imported value contains \&quot; and is delimited by &quot; but the file template is defined with &#39; as the value delimiter, the export contains unnecessary backslashes.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-65'>OTC-65</a>] -         When adding a new language it should be possible to assign the new language to specified users in the same step / tab

    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-68'>OTC-68</a>] -         When adding a new key the formerly selected file template should be pre-selected (taken from Session).
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-70'>OTC-70</a>] -         If we have many languages and keys in our database, the &quot;Entries&quot; page is very very slow.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-74'>OTC-74</a>] -         When importing a file the animation of the scrolling to the last inserted key is too slow. Remove the animation and jump directly to it.

    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-76'>OTC-76</a>] -         A new configuration setting must be added for the importer:
        - user is allowed to import phrases that are the same as in the fallback language
        Depending on this setting the importer should save or skip such phrases.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-77'>OTC-77</a>] -         When deleting a file template, there should be a possibility to delete all phrases attached to this template.
        The option &quot;unassign&quot; should be removed because we don&#39;t want to have unassigned phrases.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-78'>OTC-78</a>] -         It would be nice to have a placeholder in the file header template containing a list of all translators with edit rights for giving them credits fro their work.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-79'>OTC-79</a>] -         Clicking on a language entry should open the entries page with the filter set to this language.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-85'>OTC-85</a>] -         In the GUI the image &quot;Attention&quot; is used at many places where instead there should be shown a minus icon (icon &quot;NotOk&quot;). Find all places and replace image.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-91'>OTC-91</a>] -         The file defaultConfig.dist.ini should be renamed to config.dist.ini

    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-97'>OTC-97</a>] -         When editiing or creating a phrase and there is only one file template, the selectbox can be replaced by pure text output, because there is no selection.

    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-133'>OTC-133</a>] -         On translations index page the &quot;search for untranslated&quot; filter excludes provided inputs in other fields. This should be visualized by optically deactiviating the other inputs when using this filter.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-136'>OTC-136</a>] -         If the download packages are up-to-date, display the &quot;Export to VCS&quot; button on the export page.
    </li>
    <li>[<a href='https://mysqldumper.jira.com/browse/OTC-141'>OTC-141</a>] -         The log page should also have the page X of Y information and the &quot;records per page&quot; select box.
