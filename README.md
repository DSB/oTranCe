## oTranCe, the online translation center for your project

This project is no longer maintained and inactive. Please take a look for alternatives. 

oTranCe offers a ready to go and entirely web based translation platform to your project and your translators. The files you already translated can be imported easily and exported to language packages at any time. In case you are using a versioning system, updating your repository is just a mouse click.

All your translators will need is just a log in so they can start working on the translations straight away. The administrator is able to adjust very fine-grained rights and roles for your developers and interpreters.

### Features:
* web based
* translate phrases from anywhere using your browser
* import language files
* export language packages
* commit changes to a repository (subversion)
* set translator rights fine grained
